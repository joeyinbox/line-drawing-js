Automatic line drawing animation of elements on load

### [Demo](http://joeyclouvel.com/lab/line-drawing-js/)

Background
-------------
This plugin is based on a previous work of [Codrops](http://www.codrops.com) where their [demonstration](http://tympanus.net/Development/SVGDrawingAnimation/index2.html) implied to manually embed svg elements within the page. Moreover, if JavaScript is disabled, their content won't be displayed.
As a result, this version free users to generate and embed svg elements and will display the content normally if JavaScript is disabled or unavailable.

Getting started
-------------
- Include the plugin before the closing body tag
- Include the css file
- Add a class `animated-line` on the elements you want to animate
- Add an extra class `text` on text elements you want to animate
- Add an extra class `circle` on circle elements you want to animate
- That's all..
